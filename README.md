# Airbnb-Price-Predictor

Description: Here we are Airbnb data from six popular citites (Boston, Chicago, LA, SF, NYC, DC). This dataset consists of current listings of Airbnb housings with its respective features like bedrooms, cleaning fee, housing type, reviews, etc. Our project will focus on training the data and take the features that affect the final price of the Airbnb. Furthermore, based on the features we can predict the pricing for houses. By doing so, the model will make it easier for clients to find correct housing price and house owners can price their Airbnb competitively. In order to do so, We will clean the data and do feature engineering. Then, use different types of regression models to find the best fititng model and the most significant features.
